okay just rounding up and triaging possible anmchr commands i want to investigate adding. if anyone has any cheat engine tables about any of this that would help

Easy difficulty to add
- some kind of command to verify that the character is being loaded with a new enough version of the .asi mod
- screen positioned teleports (skrull) (sort of possible with variable commands??)
- register indirect load / store???

Probably medium (missing some info, but not much, if anyone has cheat engine tables it would help)
- mess with flying screen state / fsi state
- steering/aiming

medium-hard because of my lack of knowledge of how shots/children work
- shot/child limiter - can't do if shot is out -- maybe this should be more a cmdspatk thing
- shot/child limiter - eat old one
- manually affect shot properties from animations?
- player controls affecting shot properties, for example mvc2 (not mvc2-mvc3) sent's hold kick and move the stick up and down to steer the drones

similar, char specifics
- whatever is up with ammy slow? -- "set installs on opponent" / "set installs on all players"?
- auras / visibility groups + tying to install duration

Hard right now because I don't have enough knowledge of how these particular systems work for the game
- Start prop animation w/ time offset
- Start effect w/ time offset
- Force end effect
- Effect speed up/down/pause
- ???? what if running commands as-opponent? i'll need to think on this
- what if running the commands from another anmchr entry as a "function" and then returning

instincts say these are even harder but unsure:
- Start sound w/ time offset
- Force end sound
- Priority play sound (Voice lines play all the way through)
- this one sounds like a bit of a pipe-dream but was thinking about if maybe it'd be possible to assign an anmchr to a projectile and have it control the projectile independent of the character (???)
